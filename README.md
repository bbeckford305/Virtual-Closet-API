# Virtual Closet:
> Decide what to wear by being able to pull any garment from your closet virtually and create the perfect outfit.


Have you ever spent more time than needed deciding what to wear? Then this app is exactly what you need. I designed it with the goal in mind of allowing an indivdual to be able to store, and retreive all their garments. You have a meeting in a hour and need to find a exact type of pants and shirt. Input what your looking for and have all your items pulled for you that match those specifications

## Planning Story

To plan what the user need out we have to take into consideration what the normal process of deciding what to wear is like. The user being able to create an account and securly login to view their personal closet was the first step. We then need for the user to be able to add garments to their database. Once garments have been added the user needs to be able to pull those garments based on certain specification such as type, color and etc. The user then should be able to select the specific garments from all that was pull so they can create a outfit. Once the items are worn the user should also be able to update the item status in the database from clean to dirty. This allows for the item to not be pulled in the next search till it has been changed back to clean. The additional option for a user to be able to delete a garment from the database once the item is no longer in the user possession is also an important feature to be added.
